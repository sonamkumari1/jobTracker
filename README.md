JobTracker is a web application designed to help users keep track of the jobs they have applied to. The application provides features such as pagination, sorting, searching, and filters based on work type and job status. It is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) and employs JWT for authentication and cookies for session management.
